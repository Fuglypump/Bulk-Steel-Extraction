	<description>Adds new bills to the Electric Smelter. *No research required*

New Recipes:
- Extract metal from Slag (x3) - Smelt 3 slag chunks at a time for 30 steel
- Extract metal from debris - Smelt 1 stone chunk for 10 steel
- Extract metal from debris (x3) - Smelt 3 stone chunks at a time for 30 steel

Notes:
- Recipes which smelt 3 chunks at a time cost 15% less work than smelting single chunks at a time.
- Smelting stone chunks costs the same amount of work as smelting chunks of slag.
- Should be safe to add or remove to your saved games, just make sure you delete the bills and/or electric smelter before uninstalling to avoid any possible errors.

Supported mods:
Cupro's Stones - Adds the new stone types to the ingredients of the debris recipes if they exist.
More Stone - Adds the new stone types to the ingredients of the debris recipes if they exist.

Incompatible Mods:
- Steel Extraction - Both mods add recipes for smelting stone debris and both use the same defnames, these will either be overwritten or appear twice.
